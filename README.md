This Repo contains all of the code for a project called LOTR Converter which
converts different currencies in LOTR to others of your choice. This projects 
was developed as part of a course on UDEMY.com called "Learn iOS development 
with SwiftUI 6 and Swift 6; build complete iOS 18 apps from scratch; visionOS, 
macOS, watchOS". The app features a user-friendly interface allowing users to 
select and convert between different currencies, with an option to swap conversion 
direction. This project, hosted here on GitHub, enhanced my understanding of iOS 
development, UI/UX design, and mobile app deployment.
